        "description": "Centralized exchanges are usually regulated entities that act as intermediaries between the banking system and the bitcoin ecosystem. They allow you to buy and sell large amounts of bitcoin and withdraw it to your wallet or bank account. They usually require KYC, and therefore monitor your activity, reporting it to financial surveillance institutions to respect local laws."

      "description": "Exchanges are one of the entry and exit doors between your traditional currency (euro, dollars) and the bitcoin world. Exchanges can be regulated and KYC (Know Your Customer) compliant, or peer-to-peer and anonymous. Each exchange will offer different features, fee structures, liquidity, and customer support. Each bitcoiner will use a different one based on their needs and convictions.",

        "description": "Peer-to-peer exchanges are marketplaces where individuals exchange bitcoin for other currencies between themselves. These exchanges could be regulated or not and usually don't ask for much information (if any) about you. They simply facilitate the relationship between users. Their fees could be higher than traditional exchanges and their liquidity a bit lower. It is the preferred option for bitcoiners trying to avoid KYC."
